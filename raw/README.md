Data container for ACS Summary data
=======


### What should be here
This is where you should unzip the summary files. Currently this script is being designed to work with data listed as "By State All Tables" in the ACS summary access. For an example, you can use [Connecticut_All_Geographies_Not_Tracts_Block_Groups.zip](http://www2.census.gov/acs2013_5yr/summaryfile/2009-2013_ACSSF_By_State_All_Tables/Connecticut_All_Geographies_Not_Tracts_Block_Groups.zip) as this is the file being used to implement this tool. Unzip all the contained files into this folder `Raw`.
